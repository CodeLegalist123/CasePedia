                <p>The prosecution case in short is that there was a house belonging to Hari Singh and Mehar Singh who were tailors by profession.,
                    A day before the occurrence the said house was purchased by Bachan Kaur wife of Gurdial Singh for a consideration of Rs.10,000/-.,
                    In the sale deed there was a recital that the purchaser herself would obtain the actual physical possession.,
                    Only symbolic possession was given to the said purchaser.,
                    It is the prosecution case that PW 5 Piara Singh was the tenant in the said house on a monthly rent of Rs.80/-.,
                    The appellants in a bid to obtain actual physical possession after the purchase demolished a wall and a door of the said house in the evening of February 9,1976.,
                    Piara Singh thereater sought the help of the deceased Bhanan Singh, Dr. Kewal Krishan Sood PW 7 and Darshan Singh.,
                    The said persons inquired from the appellants as to why they had demolished a portion of the said house to which they had received the reply that since the appellants became the owners by purchase they would take possession.,
                    The deceased and the said other persons intervened in order to settle the matter amicably and desired to see the registered sale deed and the matter was postponed for such settlement on the next day.,
                    On the early morning of February 10, 1976 at 4 a.m., the appellants came in front of the house of the deceased Bhanan Singh and started hurling abuses on him.,
                    Darshan Singh at that time was armed with a sua and the remaining appellants had lathi in their hands.,
                    They asked Bhanan Singh to come out of the house and to see the consequences for rendering help to Piara Singh.,
                    Bhanan Singh and pw 4 Bhagwan Kaur then came out of the house. Piara Singh and Gurdev Singh also came out of their houses.,
                    They tried to persuade the appellants not to hurl abuses.,
                    On this Darshan Singh gave a blow with the sua on the head of the deceased Bhanan Singh, but the weapon missed the head and the dang portion of the sua hit the head.,
                    Gurdial Singh also hit Bhanan Singh with lathi on the right leg. Malkiat Singh gave lathi blow on the back of Bhanan Singh deceased.,
                    When Bhagwan Kaur, Piara Singh and Gurdev Singh advanced to intervene, they were also given blows by Gurdial Singh.,
                    Thereafter, the other appellants gave blows to Piara Singh. The accused gave some more blows to Bhanan Singh, when he had fallen.,
                    According to the prosecution case the incident had taken place near the house of Bhanan Singh and the house of the appellants was at a distance of about 60 yards from the said place.,
                    Bhanan Singh died at the said spot and the appellants then carried away his body to their house.</p>
