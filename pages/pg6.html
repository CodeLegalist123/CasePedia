                <p>The complainant P1 filed a Special Leave Petition in this court seeking leave to appeal against the judgment dated 6th April, 1993 of the High Court.  The incident for which these accused were charged is the murder of P2, son of the complainant P1 (appellant) on 13th June, 1982.,
                    As per the case of the prosecution, the complainant along with his son P2 (deceased) was getting his maize field weeded through the help of a few labourers on the morning of 13th June, 1982.,
                    His real brother P3 came on the spot and forbade the complainant from doing so.,
                    The complainant insisted that he had right to carry on the work in the field which belonged to him.,
                    On this P3, who was accompanied by his son accused P4 and P5 abused the labourers and drove them away from the field.,
                    The complainant took strong objection to this but the accused party started abusing the complainant and his son and started pelting stones on them.,
                    The complainant and his son also threw stones on the opposite party in their defence.,
                    In the meantime, some villagers came and intervened in the fight.,
                    As a result of this, the accused persons went away.,
                    The complainant and his son P2 continued with the work in the field.,
                    After a few hours, that is about 10.00 a.m., few villagers informed the complainant that the accused persons were coming back armed with weapons.,
                    The complainant did not pay heed to this warning thinking that the accused persons were his close relations.,
                    Within a short time, all the seven accused persons reached the spot.,
                    Seeing them, the complainant and his son P2 ran for their safety and entered the nearby house of P6.,
                    They hid themselves in a room by bolting the room from inside.2.,
                    However, as the main gate of the house had remained open, the accused persons rushed inside the house and broke open the door which had been bolted from inside.,
                    They entered the room where the complainant and his son P2 were hiding.,
                    P2 was dragged outside the room in the courtyard of the house where accused P4 is said to have given a bhala blow on his stomach.,
                    As a result of the blow, P2 fell down.,
                    Accused P3 gave a pharsa blow on the head of P2.,
                    The other accused persons also assaulted P2 with their weapons.,
                    The complainant tried to save his son but he was also assaulted by accused P7 and P5.,
                    While this was going on, the villagers accompanied by P9, P10, P11 and P12 came and intervened and saved the victims from further assault.,
                    However, P2 died on the spot.</p>
