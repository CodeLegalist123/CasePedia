                    PW-1 is the wife of PW-4.,
            The accused and PW-4 are the sons of P1 (hereinafter referred to as the 'deceased').,
            PW-2 is the son of PW-1.,
            P1 had certain immovable properties which he partitioned 10 years before the occurrence, and he regained a piece of land namely 10 cents, which is a poramboke, for his livelihood.,
            The accused was insisting him to give that land also.,
            There arose a civil dispute between them.,
            It also ended in favour of P1.,
            On the day of occurrence i.e, 26.05.2003 at about 7.00 A.M., PW-1 was going to the garden to pluck vegetables.,
            At that time, her father-in-law, the said P1, was cutting trees.,
            He was having a spade and aruval in hand.,
            At that time, the accused came there and questioned how he could cut the trees, and following the same, there was a wordy duel.,
            Immediately, the accused snatched the aruval and cut him on the neck and shoulder indiscriminately.,
            PW-1 on seeing this, raised alarm, and immediately, the accused fled away from the place of occurrence.,
            The said P1 met his instantaneous death.,
            The dead body was sent to the Government Hospital along with a requisition, Ex. P-2, for the purpose of autopsy.,
            The doctor gave a post- mortem certificate, Ex.P-3, with her opinion that the deceased would appear to have died of hemorrhage and shock due to injuries to major vessels.
