                <p>The prosecution case against the appellant was that on September 9, 1953, he had contracted a second marriage at Khandwa in Madhya Pradesh with one Vishna Devi though he had his first wife living whom he had not divorced and thus rendered himself liable to be punished.,
                    Along with him his second wife Vishna Devi was also charged.,
                    The learned magistrate held that the appellant had contracted a bigamous marriage which was void and that his second wife had abetted the solemnisation of the said marriage; in other words, he found that the appellant and his second wife had committed the offences.</p>
