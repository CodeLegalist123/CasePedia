                <p>On October 24, 1959, Krishan Sahai, Sales Tax Inspector, P.W. 1, alongwith Shri N. J. Warudkar, P.W. 5, and Shri Harikishan Gupta, P.W. 2, went to the shop of the appellant Mangat Rai, run under the name and style \"Mangat Rai Ram Kumar\".,
                    The officer visited the shop for a surprise check. He informed the appellant that he wanted to inspect his account books.,
                    At that time they were in the verandah which is common to the shop of the appellant and the neighboring shop of Munshiram.,
                    It is perhaps best to describe what happened in the words of the Inspector:,
                    I entered the shop of the accused for inspection and Shri Warudkar entered the shop of Munshiram.,
                    The accused, Harikishan and myself all three entered the shop of the accused.,
                    I and Harikishan sat on the Gadi of the accused and the accused Mangat Ram sat near the iron-safe.,
                    I asked the accused person to show his account-books for inspection. Many account-books were kept there.,
                    He took out 3 note-books of the size of exercise-notebooks out of them.,
                    I thought he was taking out them for showing the same to me for inspection.,
                    In the meantime Dayakishan who is the son of the accused also came into the shop. The accused kept one notebook as it was and he handed over the remaining two note-books to his son and asked him to rule away for keeping the same at his house.,
                    When the accused was turning the pages of the note-book I noticed that it contained accounts therefore, suspicion came to my mind and I demanded these note-books from that boy for inspection.,
                    That boy had the exercise-book in his right hand.,
                    I tried to snatch away the exercise book by catching hold of his left hand.,
                    When I had caught hold of that boy with my left hand the accused caught hold of my right hand and pulled me to the back side by giving me a jerk as a result of which my shirt got torn and the boy ran away.,
                    I tried to get separated from the grip of the accused so that I would be able to catch the boy but in the mean-time the accused caught hold of my waist with his both the hands and said, \"Do not touch the exercise-books.",
                    "It would be dangerous.\"</p>
