            His second wife P3 (deceased) had been residing with him alongwith her six children including daughter P9 aged 17 years (deceased).,
            He was also having a house where his first wife was residing earlier before she shifted.,
            There was dispute between him on the one hand and his wife P2 and her children on the other with regard to the house.,
            The appellant-accused and his brother were insisting for the transfer of the said house in the name of their mother at the earliest.,
            For transferring the said house in the name of his first wife, he went to Tis Hazari on 17th October, 1988 alongwith his son-in-law P10 and met his counsel who advised him to come on the next day.,
            Hence, the said property could not be transferred in the name of his wife.,
            At about 6.00 P.M., when he was sleeping in the house, he woke up on hearing the noise of a quarrel and P8, daughter of P2 abusing P3.,
            He slapped P8 and asked her to desist from abusing P3.,
            After this the appellant and P7 came into the house, P7 went inside the room alongwith P8 and then came out with a dagger.,
            P7 abused him and stabbed on his left eye, he fell down.,
            At that time, P3 intervened and protested saying as to why he was beating his handicapped father.,
            At that time, appellant snatched away dagger from P7 and started stabbing P3 repeatedly.,
            At that stage, his daughter P9 intervened and asked the appellant as to why he was stabbing P3.,
            P7 stated that she was the root of all troubles so the appellant started stabbing P9 at her abdomen, neck and other parts of her body.,
            After sometime when persons collected outside, the appellant ran away.,
            Within minutes P3 and P9 died at the spot.
