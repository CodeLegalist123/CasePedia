                    The case of the prosecution is that the informant Dr. D1 is a resident of L1.,
            On January 13, 1989 at 2010 hours he lodged a first information report at police station in which he stated that on that date at about 7.30 p.m. while he was watching the television, other members of the family were in the house.,
            His son P5, PW-1 had gone to the fields and had not returned.,
            While he was watching the television he saw that three persons entered his house with concealed faces.,
            Of them two were armed with pistols and they demanded the keys from him.,
            He could identify accused P3 by his voice, stature and eyes.,
            He then heard the cries of his daughter-in-law coming from another room and when he rushed to her room he found that two other persons were threatening her, of whom one was armed with country made pistol.,
            His daughter-in-law handed over to them whatever ornaments she was wearing at that time.,
            Two other persons then entered the room who picked up some articles.,
            Those two persons had not concealed their faces.,
            Some other dacoits also entered the room of his daughter-in-law and started making demands from her.,
            A relative of his, namely P6, PW-4, who was residing with him, told his daughter-in-law to handover the keys to the dacoits.,
            Thereafter the dacoits asked P6 to open the almirah but he was unable to do so.,
            One of the dacoits threatened to kill him if he did not open the almirah.,
            Seeing this, the informant rushed and caught that hand of the dacoit in which he was holding the pistol and pushed him towards the verandah.,
            Thereafter the informant's daughter, P7 started raising alarm.,
            Some of the dacoits were in the courtyard of the house and he recognized one of them as Rajesh Yadav who was armed with a pistol.,
            Rajesh Yadav exhorted Parshuram to fire and thereafter Parshuram fired hitting his daughter P7.,
            The dacoits also exploded bombs.,
            The informant claimed to have recognized one of the miscreants as P2 who assaulted him on his back with the barrel of his pistol as a result of which his grip over one of the dacoits, whom he had caught, loosened and that dacoit slipped away.,
            Thereafter the dacoits fled away.,
            His daughter P7 succumbed to her injuries.,
            By this time his son P5, PW-1 had also come.,
            He mentioned in his report that P20, P6, PW-4 and P30, PW-2 were also injured.,
            In the report he also gave descriptions of other dacoits whom he had not recognized.
