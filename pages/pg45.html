                    That the deceased P1 got married to P2, the 2nd respondent herein, in the year 2001.,
            In her marital home, she was ill-treated by her parents-in-law, respondents 1 and 3 herein.,
            They would constantly tell her that she was incapable of doing the house work properly, and her mother-in-law did not give her sufficient food to eat.,
            On 29.11.2002 at noon, when the deceased returned home after her bath in the pond, her mother-in-law hurled abuses at her and inquired what she had been doing at the pond.,
            When she replied that she had been washing clothes there, her mother-in-law gave her few slaps, as a result of which the deceased began to cry.,
            Her mother-in-law then directed her husband to burn her alive.,
            Her father-in-law had thus poured kerosene on her and had asked his wife to set her on fire, as a result of which her mother-in-law lit a matchstick and threw the same at her.,
            Since the deceased began to scream, her parents-in-law came out of the house and bolted the door from the outside.,
            On hearing her shriek, a few villagers sent news of the same to her parents who resided in a neighboring village, at a distance of about half a kilometer.,
            Her father, mother and uncle thus came to the place of occurrence.,
            The door was opened by them, and the deceased was taken out.,
            The deceased P1 narrated the said incident to her parents, and thereafter she was taken in a trolley to the Police Station in a severely burnt condition, where she herself lodged a report narrating the incident, and at about 2 p.m., on the basis of the complaint, an FIR, Ex.P-17 was recorded.,
            Her dying declaration was recorded by the Executive Magistrate and subsequently, the deceased was admitted to the Government Hospital at 3.25 p.m., where she died at 3.35 p.m.,
            Intimation of her death was communicated by the hospital officials to the Police.,
            The Investigating Agency thus took over the dead body of the deceased, and sent it for post-mortem.
