                    A-1 is the son A-2, who was running a nursing home at Ernakulam during the relevant period and A-4 was an Assistant Registrar, Examination Wing, Kerala University.,
            A- 1 was a Pre-degree student during the academic years 1978-79 and 1979-80 in the Mar Ivanios College, Thiruvananthapuram, affiliated to the Kerala University.,
            He appeared for the first year Pre-degree examination in April, 1979 and for second year Pre-degree examination in April/May 1980.,
            After the second year examination, A-1 got following marks as indicated in the mark list issued by the Mar Ivanios College:- Total for the optional subjects, viz. Physics, Chemistry and Biology was 387 out of 450.,
            The above mark list issued by the Kerala University to A-1, through Mar Ivanios College, Thiruvanthapuram was received by both the appellants with their acknowledgement in the mark lists kept in the college.,
            As both appellants were aware that the marks secured by the A-1 were insufficient to get an admission in any medical college for the first year MBBS course in Kerala on merit, they entered into a criminal conspiracy along with A-3 and A-4 on some day between 30.6.1980 and 10.10.1980 for forging a mark list showing higher marks and pursuant to such conspiracy A-4 in the case procured a blank mark list of Pre-degree examination and by fraudulent means and without the knowledge and authority of the Controller of Examinations (PW-1) got the impression of the facsimile signature of PW-1 and the University emblem seal affixed on the blank mark list form.,
            A-4 wrote in his own handwriting falsely and fraudulently the following marks in the forms to have been secured by A-1 in the Pre-degree final year examination:- In addition total of 420 marks out of 450 marks was shown for the optional subjects, viz. Physics, Chemistry and Biology.",
            A-4 forged the initials of the concerned section assistants, who actually prepared the true mark list issued through Mar Ivanios College and received by A-1 and A-2.,
            A-4 also attested a true copy of the mark list (Ext.P27).,
            He forged with his designation and seal and entrusted both the forged mark list and its true copy attested by him (Ext.P27) to A-1 and A-2. Ext.D-4 is the forged mark list.,
            A-1 and A-2 thereafter prepared an application form for admission to a medical college during the year 1980-81 with their signatures by incorporating the marks found in Ext.D-4, the forged mark list fully knowing the forged nature of Ext.D-4 and forwarded such application together with the attested true copy Ext.P-27 of Ext. D-4 to the medical college, Thiruvanthapuram with the fraudulent intention to make the concerned authorities to believe that the marks shown in the application are the real marks obtained by A-1 and thereby cheated the selection committee and obtained admission for the first year M.B.B.S. course on merit basis.,
            Appellants with the intention of causing disappearance of the evidence of commission of the crime destroyed the true genuine mark list/the true copy of which is marked as Ext.D-8 in this case received by them from Mar Ivanios College and thus the appellants and the other acquitted accused committed the alleged offences.,
            A-3 was an associate of A-2
