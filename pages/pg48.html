                    Filtering the unnecessary details, the prosecution case, in brief, is that the marriage between the appellant No. 1 and deceased  P1, sister of the informant, PW-2, was solemnized on 24.9.1997.,
            After the marriage the deceased stayed with her husband and the mother-in-law, the appellant No.2 herein, at the matrimonial home.,
            In the wedlock, two children, one son and a daughter were born.,
            On 11.9.2001, the informant, brother of the deceased, got a telephonic call from the accused No. 1 that his sister  P1 had committed suicide.,
            On receipt of the telephone call came along with his friend, P2, PW-20, and at that juncture, the husband of  P1,  P3, informed that the deceased was fed up with the constant ill-health of her children and the said frustration had led her to commit suicide by tying a 'dupatta' around her neck.,
            The brother of the deceased did not believe the version of  P3, and lodged an FIR alleging that the husband and the mother-in-law of the deceased, after the marriage, had been constantly asking for dowry of Rs.2 lacs from the father of the deceased, but as the said demand could not be satisfied due to the financial condition of the father, the husband and his mother started ill-treating her in the matrimonial home and being unable to tolerate the physical and mental torture she was compelled to commit suicide.,
            Be it noted, as the death was unnatural, the police had sent the dead body for post mortem and the doctor conducting the autopsy opined that the death was due to suicide.
