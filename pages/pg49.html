                <p>It has been stated that A-1 to A-7 demanded that the appellant would vacate the above-mentioned house.,
                    They tried to evict the appellant forcibly from the house but locality of the people intervened and made their efforts futile.,
                    However, on 10.06.1990 at 7.00 AM, Ayesha Khan (PW-2) while taking water from a tap which was near the gate of Khaja- Ka-Chilla saw A-1 to A-7 entering the premises.,
                    She went and informed her mother Ahmedi Begum (PW-7). The appellant (PW-1) and PW-7 closed the doors of the house so as to prevent the entry of A-1 to A-7 and their associates.,
                    However, A-1 to 7 broke open the doors of the house and gained entry into the house. When they attempted to lift the household articles, the appellant and his sister's husband Mohd. Qasim went through another door of the house to the police station to inform the highhanded acts of the accused.,
                    When PWs 7, 9, 10 and 13 prevented A- 1 and his associates from removing the household articles, they were beaten up by the accused.,
                    By the time appellant returned from the police station, A-1 and his associates loaded household articles in a lorry bearing No. ABT 6596 and emptied the house</p>
