                <p>Background facts in a nutshell are as follows: The deceased is one P1, a Sri Lankan student, who was residing in the first floor of the house belonging to one P2 (P.W.1).,
                    The Accused is also a Sri Lankan student studying in a different college, but staying in the second floor of the same premises.,
                    The occurrence allegedly took place in the afternoon of 22.4.2003.,
                    The First Information Report was lodged by P.W.1 on 24-4-2003 at about 9.30 A.M. It was indicated in the First Information Report that on 24.4.2003 at 9.00 A.M., while the informant had gone to perform pooja in the first floor of the house, he got foul smell in the last room of the first floor and found blood seeping through the front door.,
                    On opening the window he noticed that P1 was lying in a pool of blood with her face covered with a bag.,
                    On the basis of the aforesaid F.I.R., investigation was taken up initially by P.W.40.,
                    Subsequently on the basis of the order of the High Court, such investigation was completed by P.W.42.The accused is stated to have been arrested on suspicion on 26.4.2003.,
                    On the basis of the statement of the accused, prosecution discovered many materials including a knife and a log allegedly used for killing.,
                    Initially, P.W.40 suspected the role of P.W.1, his wife P.W.2, P.W.3, from whose house certain incriminating material were recovered allegedly on the basis of statement of the accused as well as P.W.4, who was working as a cleaner in the vehicle of P.W.1.,
                    Subsequently, however, P.W.42, who took over investigation from P.W.40 filed charge-sheet only against the present appellant on the footing that P.Ws. 1 to 4 had no role to play in the crime.,
                    The prosecution relied upon only circumstantial evidence, namely, confessional statements of the accused leading to recovery of various incriminating materials.,
                    Ex. P-6 is the statement leading to recovery of Travel bags (M.Os. 2 & 3), knife (.M.0.5), wooden log (M.0.28), rubber gloves (M.0.29 series) cotton rope with human hair (MN.O.30 series), two sponges soaked with blood (M.0.31 series), bloodstained blue clolour jean pant (M.0.32), bloodstained white banian (M.0.33), colour banian (M.0.34), bloodstained grey colour pant (M.0.35), bloodstained pillow (M.0.36), plastic bucket (M.0.37) from the house of P.W.3.,
                    Ex-P-8 is the statement leading to recovery of computer and its accessories (M.Os. 6 to 17) from the house of P.W.15, a classmate of the accused.,
                    Ex. P-10 is the statement relating to jewelleries, ultimately leading to recovery of gold ingots (M.O.18 series) from the house of P.W.19 on the basis of other connecting statements of P.W.17 and P.W.18.,
                    These three statements, Exs. P-6, P-8 and P-10 dated 26-4-2003, were made before P.W.40 in the presence of P.W.22 and C.W.1.,
                    The other confessional statement Ex. P-12 dated 22-9-2003 made before P.W.42 and Subbiah and P.W.24, led to recovery of \"M\" dollar (M.0.38) and key chain with key chain in (M.0.39) from the toilet in the room of the accused.,
                    The prosecution has also relied upon the alleged motive to the effect that the accused urgently wanted money with a view to increase his marks in Mathematics and, therefore, the accused had stolen articles belonging to the deceased.</p>
