                <p>This appeal arises out of the judgment dated 23.8.2016, passed by the High Court wherein High Court has dismissed the petition filed by the appellant.,
                    Records reveal that the parents of the appellant, namely, P1 and P2, entered into an agreement to sell dated 14.1.1997 with Respondent No.2 herein.,
                    The sale consideration was Rs.33,50,000/- (Rupees Thirty Three Lakhs Fifty Thousand only); the parents of the appellant received earnest money of Rs.6,50,101/- (Rupees Six Lakhs Fifty Thousand One Hundred One only) and remaining amount was to be paid at time of registration of the sale deed.,
                    The appellant however denies about the receipt of earnest money of Rs.6,50,101/- by his parents.,
                    It seems that the said transaction for agreement to sell was not completed.,
                    Civil Suit in that regard is filed and is pending.,
                    Respondent No.2 lodged the complaint before the police authorities, making allegations of cheating, breach of trust, etc., against the parents of the appellant as well as the appellant, which came to be registered as FIR No.03/2016.,
                    Charge-sheet No.23/2016 also came to be filed against the three persons, including the appellant.</p>
