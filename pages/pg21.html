                    The appellant, Chetan Dass, and the respondent, Smt. Kamla Devi, were married on November 30, 1976 at Vijaynagar District Ganganagar according to the Hindu rites and rituals.,
            The appellant was serving as Compounder in the Medical Health Department in the State of Rajasthan.,
            After the marriage, the respondent was taken to Kirawad, the original village of the appellant, where she stayed for about 8-9 months.,
            The appellant was posted in Government Hospital in Hanumangarh.,
            He had been visiting his village home off and on.,
            According to the appellant, since his village house was a kucha structure with insufficient residential accommodation, the respondent was not happy as she came from better background and standard of living.",
            Therefore, she had always been interested in living with her parents in Vijaynagar.,
            It is also the case of the appellant that the parents of the respondent always desired that he may get himself transferred to Vijaynagar and, for that purpose, many items of presentations in dowry at the time of marriage, for example, bed and bedding, sofa set, almirah and golden jewellery etc. were retained at Vijaynagar.,
            It was, however, not possible for the appellant to live at Vijaynagar.,
            The marriage of DW-3, Ravi Kumar, the brother of Kamla Devi, was to take place in November, 1977 and, in that connection, she left for her parents house at Vijaynagar in October, 1977.,
            She did not return after the marriage of her brother despite requests made by the appellant and his parents for her return.,
            On the other hand, it is stated that she started making allegations against the appellant for leading an adulterous life.,
            The appellant felt mentally tortured on such false allegations. He, therefore, filed an application after about 2 years of the marriage but later the relations between the two improved.,
            The appellant, therefore, got his petition for divorce dismissed.,
            Kamla Devi started living at the residence of Chetan Dass in Kirawad and they had also consummated their marriage.,
            The case of the appellant further is that as desired by Smt. Kamla Devi, Chetan Dass brought her to Ganganagar and both started residing in Ganganagar.,
            But this could not pull on for long and the respondent is said to have always been pressurising the appellant to permanently reside in Vijaynagar.,
            After some time, Lokuram, father of the respondent, took her back to Vijaynagar.,
            All efforts made by the appellant, his relatives and members of their community failed to persuade Kamla Devi to return to live with Chetan Dass any more.,
            According to the appellant, the brief period during which Kamla Devi had changed her attitude and had started living with him was not a genuine gesture on her part or an effort to live together rather it was for the purpose that the appellant got his divorce petition dismissed.
