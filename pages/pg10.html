                <p>The appellant P1 was employed in the Police Department.,
                    He started his service as a constable on a salary of Rs. 13 per month from August 1, 1930.,
                    In 1946 his pay was increased to Rs. 46 per month.,
                    He was appointed a Head constable on a salary of Rs. 50 per month in 1947.,
                    He officiated as a Sub-Inspector of Police sometime in 1948 and 1949 on a salary of Rs. 150 per month.,
                    On March 1, 1949, he was reverted to his post of Head constable.,
                    Between the dates February 27, 1951, and September 9, 1952, he was posted as a Head constable attached to the L1.,
                    The charge against him was that in that capacity he dishonestly or fraudulently misappropriated or otherwise converted to his own use many articles, principally those seized in connection with excise offences kept in deposit in the said L1.,
                    These articles included opium, bottles of liquor etc. The charge further stated that a sum of Rs. 9,284-1-0 was recovered on a search of his house on September 9 and 10, 1952 and this amount was disproportionate to the known sources of income of the appellant.,
                    There was an allegation by the prosecution that the acts of dishonest misappropriation etc. were committed by the appellant in conspiracy with two other persons called P2 and P3.</p>
